# Health Hack
I am sure there are times where you can't share the thing with your 
best friends or family or anyone.
Maybe its a guilt, bad habit, peer pressure, bullying or any such thing you are afraid
to come up forward and speak about because you are afraid you will be judged and your thought 
would not be listened.

Well here we bring a small yet powerful app where you can find the right guidance for these types of things.

## Project Idea
App comprises of 2 things
1. Articles 
2. Online guidance

### Articles
They are the motivation for the users before interacting with the mentors,
they can read about peoples who where at there place at some time and successfully tackled with the
problems and are now more than  happy with life.

### Online Guidance
A 1-1 guidance with the expertise of the industry so that they can speak freely about the problem since
they will be anonymous to the mentors and there identity will not be revealed at any cost.


## Why This Project
We all have been through times where maybe if we would have been seeking for the guidance
but were afraid to ask at any cost. So it was some of our own personal experience and some friends who if would 
have been provided right guidance would be in right path.


## Workflow
1. Homepage would consist of the interface where user would be able to choose the problems they are facing.
2. Form would be submitted and some links will be brought for user to read about success stories and
to make them feel they can do it!
3. A room id will be mailed to both the user and the mentors present in database.
4. Using the room id the user can have mentoring with the mentor and seek right guidance.

## Project Progress far now :-
Backend has been completed !
Successfully sending of mails.
Creation of room for private guidance with mentors and no chat record(real time)
We are delayed with front end but will soon catch up with it.
